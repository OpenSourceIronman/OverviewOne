++ Description ++
	The SwifRradio package contains essential software utilities necessary for performing RPC protocol-based packet communications with a SWIFT-SDR device using any host device capable of executing Python binaries. The aim of this package is to provide a simple and intuitive Python interface for commanding and controlling SWIFT-SDR units while also abstracting away the lower-level complexities associated with the underlying RPC protocol.
