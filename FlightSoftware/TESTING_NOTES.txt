Instructions for manually testing
   ADACS commands on the Pumpkin test bus
-----------------------------------------

1. Connect to the test bus

  $ ssh root@192.168.1.73

  The password is "password".

2. Start a Supernova process

  $ /home/debian/sn

  Leave this process running.  You may want to connect again.

3. Enable the MAI power

  $ python /root/test/MAI_power.py ON

4. Start receiving the MAI telemetry

  $ python /root/test/mai_telemetry.py 

  Leave this process running.  You may want to connect again.

5. Send some MAI commands

  $ python MAI_command.py M 0

  ... and observe the telemetry change.

  $ python MAI_command.py M 3

  ... and observe the telemetry change.

6. That's as far as we got.
