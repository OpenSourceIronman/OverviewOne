I. Manually testing ADACS commands on the Pumpkin test bus
----------------------------------------------------------

1. Connect to the test bus

  $ ssh root@192.168.1.73

  The password is "password".

2. Start a Supernova process

  $ /home/debian/sn

  Leave this process running.  You may want to open another window.

3. Enable the MAI power

  $ python /root/test/MAI_power.py ON

4. Start receiving the MAI telemetry

  $ python /root/test/mai_telemetry.py 

  Leave this process running.  You may want to open another window.

5. Send some MAI commands

  $ python MAI_command.py M 0

  ... and observe the telemetry change.

  $ python MAI_command.py M 3

  ... and observe the telemetry change.

6. That's as far as we got.


----------------------------------------------------------
II. Testing TK1 commands using O1 software.
----------------------------------------------------------

1. Connect to the BBB

  $ ssh root@192.168.1.70

  The password is "password".

2. Start a Supernova process

  $ /home/debian/sn

  Leave this process running.  You may want to open another window.

3. On the TK1 (or other 192.168.1.71 machine), set the SUPERNOVA_ID

  $ export SUPERNOVA_ID=1

4. On the TK1 (or other 192.168.1.71 machine), run the main agent.

  $ FlightSoftware/tk1_main.py

  Leave this process running.  You may want to open another window.

4. On *either* the TK1 or the BBB, issue a command.  For example, any of:

  $ ./run_hardware.py power_cameras 0
  $ ./run_hardware.py power_cameras 1

  These should be handled by the tk1_main.py process.  If they are
  unimplemented there, an exception will be thrown (and the process
  will die).
